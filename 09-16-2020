Integrated a Cart system using React Context (CartContext.tsx) so that products can be added to and managed globally across the website.

Connected the Cart icon in the navigation bar to display the number of items in the cart, with routing to the Cart page.

Fixed provider wrapping issues by properly setting up CartProvider in main.tsx.

Cleaned up styling issues after wrapping contexts to ensure TailwindCSS and existing styles applied correctly.

Planned and documented how to upgrade the Quiz feature so that quiz answers dynamically map to categories and display relevant products from the shop. A professional Cursor AI prompt has been prepared for implementing this enhancement.

Next Steps (Planned for Next Week):

Implement the upgraded Quiz system, linking user answers to product categories via a clean mapping structure.

Display recommended products dynamically within the quiz results page, using the same product card design as the Shop page.

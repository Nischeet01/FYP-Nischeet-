Weekly Report – NepaliCraft Website Development

This week, I made significant progress on my NepaliCraft project:

Code Adjustments:
I refined and adjusted the existing website code to improve structure and layout in preparation for upcoming feature integrations.

Objective Development:
I also outlined key objectives that will guide the next stages of the platform's development:

Build an AI-Based Recommendation System
Design a recommendation engine that incorporates a cultural personality test to align user preferences with Nepali handicrafts and traditions.

Create a Cultural Questionnaire
Develop a questionnaire linking personal interests to relevant crafts and cultural topics. Over time, incorporate user browsing history to personalize suggestions further.

Enable Collaborative Custom Orders
Introduce a feature allowing users to directly collaborate with artisans—choosing materials, sizes, and themes—with real-time updates provided through the platform.

Promote Cultural Authenticity and Transparency
Ensure all products showcase artisan profiles, origin stories, and detailed price breakdowns to strengthen cultural understanding and trust.

Platform Evaluation and Feedback Integration
Engage users and artisans to gather feedback on usability, satisfaction, and cultural value. Use this input to refine and enhance the platform.

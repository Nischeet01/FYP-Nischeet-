Authentication System Refinement

Tasks Completed:

Integrated JWT-based authentication in the Django backend using rest_framework_simplejwt.

Fixed login state refresh issue where the username only appeared after page reload.

Updated frontend AuthContext and Navigation.tsx to ensure dynamic login state rendering.

Improved “Get Started” button behavior — now conditionally shows user name after login.

Handled redirect flow for Buy Now → Login → Checkout without page reload.

Applied better error handling for failed logins and invalid tokens.

Key Learnings:

Understood how React contexts interact with asynchronous authentication APIs.

Improved session management by syncing localStorage and React state.

Next Steps:

Add password reset, email verification, and refresh tokens for improved account security.

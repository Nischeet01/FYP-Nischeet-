This week, I set up the connection between the frontend and backend. The frontend now attempts to fetch categories and products directly 
from the Django REST API, instead of relying on mock data. This ensures that data displayed on the website is dynamic and managed from the backend.

Next Weekâ€™s Plan

Next week, I will add sample data (categories and products) to the backend using fixtures or through the admin panel, so that the Shop page displays 
real content. I will also focus on improving the frontend design with the chosen color palette, enhance the product detail page, and ensure smooth 
navigation across the site. If time permits, I will begin preparing for deployment of both backend and frontend.

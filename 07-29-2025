This week, I learned about apps and templates in Django. 
I explored how Django projects are organized using apps, 
allowing for modular and reusable components. I created 
multiple apps within a project and registered them in the 
settings. I also worked with Django templates to build 
dynamic web pages, using template tags and expressions to 
display content from views. Overall, I gained a better 
understanding of Djangoâ€™s structure and how to render HTML
pages using templates.

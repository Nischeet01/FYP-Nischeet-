Implemented listing filters by status, keyword, and artisan username.

Enhanced design to support “Join Collaboration” button and artisan profile linking.

Added safe backend logic to handle anonymous and authenticated submissions.

Key Learnings:

Improved knowledge of DRF serializers, file uploads, and frontend form-data handling.

Next Steps:

Add searchable artisan directory and real-time collaboration interactions (e.g., request responses, join options).

Replace static “Collaboration Ideas” section with dynamic, database-driven content.

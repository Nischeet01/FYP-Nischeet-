This week, I refined the Literature Search Methodology section for my NepalCraft project. I structured it into five clear subsections: Search Strategy, Databases and Sources, 
Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria, Evaluation Metrics, and Reference Management. I enhanced the clarity, academic tone, and alignment with my project's goalsâ€”particularly 
focusing on AI-driven personalization, cultural storytelling, and user-centered design. The refined methodology will support a systematic and rigorous literature review 
in the upcoming stages of the project and is now ready for inclusion in my dissertation.

Week 2 – Product Image Upload & Artisan Dashboard

Tasks Completed:

Enabled image uploads for products via Django admin.

Updated serializers and API endpoints to support product images.

Created an Artisan Dashboard for managing products (add, edit, delete).

Ensured artisans can upload products directly through the web interface instead of only Django admin.

Challenges Faced:

Existing products without images caused rendering issues.

Needed to configure media root and URL settings in Django to serve uploaded images correctly.

Next Steps:

Add image upload capability to the artisan frontend dashboard.

Display product thumbnails properly in all pages (Shop, Product Detail, Profile).

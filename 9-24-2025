Tasks Completed:

Integrated user authentication (Login, Register, Profile) into the NepalCraft platform.

Connected the frontend "Get Started" button to the authentication system.

Added JWT-based authentication for secure login sessions.

Configured user roles (Artisan and Customer) in Django backend.

Implemented token validation and protected routes in React.

Challenges Faced:

Page refresh was required for username updates after login.

Redirect after login (e.g., to checkout) did not trigger immediately.

Next Steps:

Improve user session persistence and page redirection after login.

Refine error handling and token refresh system.

This week, I finalized the rewritten Literature Review and Methods report, strengthening thematic sections (AI personalization, co-creation) with updated references 
and refining methodological details like Agile/UCD workflows and testing strategies. Concurrently, I initiated frontend development using Django, setting up the project
structure with PostgreSQL models, implementing core features including user authentication (role-based access), a responsive product catalog with filtering, 
and a dynamic AJAX-based cultural personality quiz interface. Static assets are hosted via AWS S3, aligning with the technical architecture outlined in the report.
